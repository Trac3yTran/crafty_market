## **T2A2 - Marketplace Project - Crafty Market**


### **R7 | The Problem**:

Crafty Market is an online marketplace where people come together to buy and sell their creations and allows consumers the opportunity to admire, purchase and find inspiration from a  wide variety of homemade items. Currently, in the market, there is Ety known for focusing on handmade vintage items and craft supplies, but the downside is their high fees. Etsy fees include once an item sells, there is a 5% transaction fee on the sale price. If you accept payments through Etsy Payments, they will also collect a 3-4% + AU$0.25 payment processing fee when an item is sold. Whilst the fees are generally lower if you sell in bulk but for someone that create a few items its consider quite high and there won't be any return on investment to the seller. 

#

### **R8 | The Solution**:

Crafty Market is a  marketplace that focuses on allowing the seller to sell their creations without any fees. There are no processing fees as buyer and seller can exchange details for organising method of payment outside of the website. Crafty  Market wants to encourage people to share their creative ideas and place for people to get some exposure. Itâ€™s not uncommon for sellers to start on Crafty Market then grow their brand and create a website. The seller can drive traffic from Crafty marketplace listings to their website where customers get an even better taste of what they have to offer.
